#here I create a function that will print out any character's health
#the word 'player' in the parenthesis is the function's paramter, more on this later
def print_health(player):
	print(player["health"]);

print_health(johnny);
#calling a function means you are activating it

#create a function that prints out any characters name, don't forget the paramter!
#remember you need the keyword 'def' to say you are creating a function
#don't forget about whitespace!

#create one function for each characteristic of johnny which will print it out
#if you have a hair color characteristic then you need a function to print out the name of the color, and so on
#make sure to call your function
